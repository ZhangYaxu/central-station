## Central Station

Central Station is a project management platform built with software development in mind.  It aims to provide
a centralized place for project management functions, issues, milestones and releases.  The goal is to use
Central Station as tool to facilitate Agile Methodology but it should be flexible enough to allow the customization
of any given workflow.

Central Station is a work in progress.


### Apps

Central station is broken up into a series of applications that provide it's overall functionality.

* Issues
* Projects
* Accounts
* Sprints

In Addition to these ``apps`` Central Station has a core module which provides a wrapper for 
common and distributed functionality.
